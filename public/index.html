                        <h2>Mystery of Patriarch's Maze</h2> 
                        <p>
                       It appears that there has been a robbery. I know that you are aware that someone broke into our house again. Seems that the intruder removed the window screen from the front window in the dinning room, crawled through the opened window, subdued Arrow, collapsed the dog gate and then proceeded upstairs. They then entered the bed room and ransacked dresser drawers looking for valuables. Later investigation revealed only some cash was taken, or so we supposed!
The perpetrator then went downstairs, replaced the dog gate, crawled through the window and put the screen back in place.
We called the Sheriff   who came and looked over the situation. He did notice that a bed pillow was missing its cover, leading him to believe that something more was missing, something that required this 'bag' in which to carry. After carefully checking for missing articles and thorough inventory checks, we came to the conclusion the nothing else was takenâ€¦..
A few weeks later there arrived a package delivered by UPS. It was addressed to me. Upon opening the box I was shocked at what was in there! Several articles inside included photos, journal pages ,some of which appeared to have been torn from a notebook, various sketches, drawings, charts, and instruction sheets describing curious riddles and problems Also included was a letter from MB explaining the contents of this package.
As per his instructions, I am not at liberty to divulge MB's name out of fear of the person he suspects has been responsible for the break-in at our home as well as string of other break-ins around the area. In fact he cautioned me to tell no one about his investigation and to not reveal any of the contents of this package. But because of the seriousness of this matter along with my trust in you to keep things 'under the collar' so to speak, I am sharing this with all of you. Besides, these things do not add up to me so I need some help making sense of all this. I will be sending you some of the articles and a copy of the letter from MB that was included. If you have any insights after examining the contents please pass in on.
        Now do not underestimate this nefarious scoundrels' willingness to inflict  pain upon those who do not cooperate with him. I've done some research into this Blonde Goatee guy and found that he is a very scary dude. It has been said that he will actually boil his victims in hot oil after popping out there eyes with a butter knife!
       So in order for us to find whatever it is that he has stolen and hidden away, you must determine what it is you are looking for, and then follow the trail of evidence and clues to discover the hiding place. NOW THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!, because this fellow is very cunning and ruthless in his endeavors you must make yourself as inconspicuous as possible. I am suggesting that you try to blend in with his life style and dress appropriately, Arrrh! We will compare notes when we come together in a few days

                        Yes indeed. As I said to begin with, there is a mystery afloat. Many questions, many answers, or no answers at all. Questions like; Who are these characters and why do they no who I am? Also, Why do certain aspects of this story seam familiar and so very hard too believe? Why does William clay appear to be the hero and his brother act like the villain? And why hasn't anyone mentioned Spot? And of utmost concern, who is this Mr. Hand and why does Rotteh'bury Coplet fear him?

                        <p>
                       So there you have it. William is captive on the Jolly Time whose captain is Black Beard he pirate. Neither Black Beard nor William realize there relationship to each other. And what about that Rotten'bury, the Evil Blonde Goatee?
William soon realizes why he was taken prisoner and the rest of the crew of the Lunar Watch were left behind. It was his mother who had convinced Black Beard that  the twins he had disowned so long ago were indeed his. Because Rotten'bury had caused his father to abandon his baby children is why Black Beard banished him from the family business. He new now the only way he could inherit the Jolly Time was to reconcile with his mother. Hence, all his actions were to impress his mother, with the idea that those same deeds or the results of such, would win the heart of his beloved Mobalena. So the story begins.

                        <h2>Rotten'bury Caplet'</h2> 
                        <p>
                        Yes, he left the orphanage,leaving evidence that he was troubled. All the children of the orphanage were found dead, all the household cash was gone, and most disturbing was a pile of dirty socks under the bed! Although no one had seen him do these things, it is believed that William Clay was responsible for the acts.Most likely he had discovered a letter left by his mother when she delivered her twins to the orphanage.That letter was to be read to William when he became of age, but it had been put away and forgotten.
 	The letter explained how much his mother loved him and his sister and that they would be reunited someday.She did not mention his father or the fact that he was the notorious Black Beard.
Black Beard's wife, who's name Was Janette'  Rotten'bury, was the daughter of a French baker by the name of Grande' Rotten'bury.She learned to create the most delicious confections and breads.Black Beard dearly loved Janette'and he very much liked her many baked goods fresh from the oven.(nothin' says lovin like.....)
Black Beards given name was Orville Caplet'. Needless to say, you dare not refer to him by that moniker. So when Janette' gave birth to their first son, he given the name Rotten'bury Caplet'. He grew up learning his fathers business, but he was drawn to the galley whenever his mother was baking and would pop in to beg for fresh rolls or biscuits.She endearingly named him Popin. He disliked this name as much as his given name of Rotten'bury. When he became old enough he struck out on his own.He became notorious in his own rite as an evil conniving, no good 'son-of-a-sea biscuit', feared all across the seven seas. He feared one one, except one, Mr. Hand.
Rotteh'bury Caplet' became known as the Evil Blonde Goatee, for obvious reasons, and was the scourge of the ocean.

                        <p>
                       William ran away from the orphanage with hopes of finding his sister, Mobalena, and his mother two. He discovered that Mobalena was working as a waitress at the Orville Lounge. So he ventured off to find her. The day he walked into that pirate hang out he saw Mobalena , and after asking a few question,he knew she was his twin sister. They both were overjoyed that they had been reunited and held each other in an affectionate embrace, when, who should walk in at that moment but, you guessed it, the Blonde Goatee!!!!
Mobalena quickly let bo of her brother and attempted to introduce William to to Rotteh'bury but he just glared at both of them.He refused to believe their story.(You remember his envious, jealous heart) Rotteh'bury Caplet decided then and there to devise a plan to do away with William, and then determine how to reconcile with Mobalena as well as with his mother.
 	William new now that events in his life were to become some what adventurous. Wanting to find his mother coupled with his desire to sail the high sees prompted hime to say goodbye to Mobalena, for now.She cautioned him to beware of the Blonde  Goatee because of his reputation for inflicting pain on those who get in his way.

                        <h2>A little history</h2> 
                        <p>
                        Let me back up a little. You see, William Clay had a tough start in life. He grew up as an orphan.Shortly after his birth, his mother was forced to give a new home. She was married to that notorious pirate Black Beard.Because she was a very beautiful woman,Black Beard was very easily made jealous when any other man would even as much as look at her. This couple already had a so by the name of Rotten-bury Caplet. Now this son was envious of all the attention that his new siblings (yes, twins were born).were getting from his mother, so he tried to convince his father, Black Beard, that his wife had been unfaithful to him and that the babies were not his. Some traits seem to be passed from one generation the the next.
Black Beard told his wife, Janette, that those babies had to go! She was devastated but knew that to resist her husband would put her life, as well as the children's lives in danger. She would just have to find someone to take the babies .So one day while the Jolly Time was in port, she took her newborns and left them at the local orphanage.
William grew up not knowing his parents. The couple operated the orphanage gave him his name, however, his twin sister was adopted by another family and thus the children were separated. 	Over the years the Clays were able to shape his young life, molding him into a fine young fellow. They were very proud of William until the day when they discovered that he had gone !

                        <p>
                       OK. Let me tell you a little story.Maybe you will take me seriously after you here what I have to tell you.
This is a story about an average, everyday, fun-loving, biscuit-eating, normal family.I'll start by telling you about the young and adventurous William Clay. From his earliest boyhood days, Wm wanted to work on a merchant ship and sail the 'seven sees'. So when he was eighteen years old, Wm hired on as a deckhand on the merchant clipper-ship, the 'Lunar Watch'.This vessel sailed all around the globe caring all types of precious cargo to various ports throughout the world.Wm was living his dream, but soon his 'bubble' was about to pop!
One night while he was performing his duties, which included stowing the ship's tackle and equipment and generally keeping the deck in order ,Wm noticed a ship approaching from the East. Because there was not yet a full moon, he couldn't identify craft. Before he could give a warning to the captain, the mystery ship came along side of the Lunar Watch and several unsavory looking thugs came aboard. They proceeded to bind and gage the entire crew, about seven in all, including William Clay.They began looting the cargo, carrying may bags to their own ship. Wm was also forced to board this ship, and was thrown in the hold! The thug in charge warned the captain of the Lunar Watch  not to pursue they or they would harm Wm in some unimaginable way!! William Clay was now a hostage on the pirate ship,Jolly Time.

Your responses, those who even bothered to reply, lead me to think you aren't taking my concerns for what they are. These sightings are real. If you want corny, I'll give you corny.

                        I think I saw a pirate! Well it looked like it could have been a pirate. Like I said before,strange things have been occurring. And just hear, but at other locations as well. I don't want say where just yet so as not to alarm anyone. Think I need to recruit some help to uncover the reason for what this could be. I know, what you thought was a serious concern, must now seam like a silly joke. But I know what I saw.
